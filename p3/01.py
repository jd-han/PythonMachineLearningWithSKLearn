In this part of our machine learning tutorial with scikit-learn and Python, we're covering how to acquire, label and organize our data, as well as figure out which machine learning algorithm to use.

Flowchart for figuring out which machine learning algorithm to use: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html

To get company data, you can use sec.gov, finance.yahoo.com, or many other locations.

To alleviate the need for people to suck up tons of bandwidth, I have compiled and zipped up a sample dataset that is the straight HTML data as if you had parsed Yahoo Finance for over a decade.
